Option #1: Storing an ArrayList
Create a Java program that will store 10 student objects in an ArrayList, ArrayList<Student>. A student object consists of the following fields:

int rollno
String name
String address
Implement two comparator classes to sort student objects by name and by rollno (roll number). Implement your own selection sort method and place your code in a separate Java source file. Do not use a sort method from the Java collections library.

Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.
